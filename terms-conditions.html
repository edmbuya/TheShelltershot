            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">13. Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>Refunds are processed in accordance with our Cancellation Policy (see Section 3). This Refund Policy explains when refunds are eligible, how they are processed, and any fees that may apply.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Guests who cancel more than 24 hours before the scheduled check-in time are eligible for a full refund. Refunds for other cancellation windows are governed by the Cancellation Policy and may vary by property.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Refundable Cases:</strong> Bookings cancelled within 24 hours of check-in, no-shows, and early departures are generally non-refundable unless exceptional circumstances apply and the Company approves a refund.</li>
              <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Approved refunds will be processed within <strong>7–14 business days</strong> from the date of approval. The time for funds to appear in the guest’s account may vary by payment provider or bank.</li>
              <li><strong>Method of Refund:</strong> Refunds will, where possible, be returned using the same payment method originally used for the booking (e.g., M-Pesa, credit card, or bank transfer). If that is not possible, we will contact you to arrange an alternative refund method.</li>
              <li><strong>Administrative Fees:</strong> Reasonable administrative or transaction fees may be deducted from the refund amount (e.g., card processing fees or third-party charges). Any such fees will be disclosed in the refund notification.</li>
              <li><strong>Disputes & Contact:</strong> If you believe you are due a refund or wish to dispute a decision, please contact us at the address or email provided in Section 12. We will attempt to resolve disputes promptly and may require supporting documentation (such as proof of booking or evidence of exceptional circumstances).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="note">Note: All refunds are subject to applicable taxes, exchange rate differences, and the terms set by your payment provider. The Company reserves the right to update this Refund Policy; changes will be posted on the website and will apply to future bookings.</p>
